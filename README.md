## Project
### SQL
- Database Design for Hotel
  - Project Summary: The NorthGate Hotel Chain Database Design project aimed to create a comprehensive system to support NorthGate's daily operations, including room bookings, service management, and employee assignments. The database features 13 entities, such as Hotel, Room, Customer, Employee, and Service, connected through 12 relationships and organized into 22 tables. It tracks customer bookings, service orders, and employee responsibilities while storing historical room prices for data analysis. Assumptions in the design include single room check-in/out dates per order and separate service orders per room. This database enables NorthGate to streamline operations, improve customer service, and facilitate data-driven decisions.
  - Report: [Report Database Design for Hotel](https://github.com/mariannawang/mariannawang.github.io/blob/main/SQL/Database%20Design%20for%20Hotel.pdf)
  - Skills: Database Design; Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling; SQL; Data Normalization; Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
    
### Power BI
- Job Placement Data Analytics & Automation Dashboard
  - Project Summary: This project aimed to provide actionable insights into job orders and placements across U.S. staffing brands (Jan 2018 - Jun 2023) using Power BI. I developed interactive dashboards to help regional leaders monitor trends, assess supply and demand by job function, and plan future strategies. By cleaning and transforming data with Power BIâ€™s query editor and using DAX for complex calculations, I enabled data-driven decision-making, allowing leaders to focus on high-demand areas and optimize resource management. The analysis excluded national accounts and focused on retail accounts.

  - Skills: Power BI; Data Analysis Expressions (DAX); Data Visualization; Data Transformation and Cleaning; Dashboard Development


### Tableau
- Google Fiber Customer Service FCR Dashboard
  - Project Summary: This project analyzed repeat customer calls for the Google Fiber Customer Service Team to identify patterns and provide actionable insights. Using data from three months in 2022, the analysis revealed that 80.24% of repeat calls were related to internet and wifi issues (Type_5) and technician troubleshooting (Type_2), with Market_1 generating the highest volume of repeat calls. The results were visualized in an interactive Tableau dashboard, offering recommendations to improve service efficiency. These include providing additional training for handling technical issues and allocating more resources to Market_1 to reduce repeat calls and enhance customer satisfaction.

### Python
- Ride-Hailing Data Analysis & Predictive Modeling for Pricing and Dispatch Optimization
  - Project Summary: This project focuses on leveraging big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning techniques to improve ride-hailing efficiency, user experience, and delivery. Using data from multiple websites, the project involves data extraction, cleaning, and visualization to analyze key factors like weather, driving models, and location. The initial phase aims to identify correlations and distributions, while future work will include simulating driving patterns, predicting weather impacts on ride-hailing, and assessing the likelihood of delays. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of ride-hailing dynamics and optimize performance.

- Flight Cancellation & Punctuality Rate Prediction
  - Project Summary: The goal of this project is to analyze and predict flight delays using data provided by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). By examining factors such as airport traffic flow and weather conditions, the project aims to help travelers make more informed decisions and optimize travel efficiency. Utilizing a dataset of seven million U.S. flights from 2018, which includes 28 variables, we found that nearly 20% of flights were delayed. Key factors influencing delays include weather and air traffic at both departure and destination airports. For airport flow data, we used the DOT website, while weather data was gathered through web scraping.

- Resume Screening and Keyword Matching Automation
  - Project Summary: This project involved developing a Python-based AI model to analyze resume content by identifying high-frequency keywords and matching them with client job descriptions. The model automated the candidate screening process, improving operational efficiency by 20%. By leveraging AI, the system streamlined recruitment workflows, allowing for faster and more accurate job-to-candidate matching.

### R
- Electricity Consumption Prediction Model Evaluation
  - Project Summary: This project focused on evaluating the performance of a predictive model by comparing predicted electricity consumption values for 2011 against actual values. The model performed well, with a relatively small Mean Squared Error (MSE). The analysis showed that the model predicted electricity consumption most accurately in May, while July and August had higher MSE values, indicating less accurate predictions during these months. The study highlighted the influence of external factors, such as energy conservation initiatives in the treatment group, which impacted the model's ability to predict consumption accurately when compared to a control group.
